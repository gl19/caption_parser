1. Press the 'Select File' button to choose a caption file. If it is .srt or .dfxp, the file will automatically be converted to a .txt file. 
2. Based on the original file type, press 'SRT Parse' or 'DFXP Parse.' 
3. The formatted and parsed text should show up in the text box. You can simply select all and copy from there.

## Other
The executable for this program is seen as a virus, but I can't really do anything about that. The source code is here and the executable was made with pyinstaller, so I you want to use the executable, you will have to allow the program.
